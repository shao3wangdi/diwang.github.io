 <li><i>Estimating Smooth GLM in Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy Model with Public Unlabeled Data.</i><a href="papers/ALT2021_GLM.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> Abstract<a href="#NIPS2020_glms" id="22_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('22');">&#9660</a>

        In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. 
Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to process 
some additional public but unlabeled data. 
We first show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for 
GLM (under some mild assumptions), if each data record is i.i.d sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. 
The sample complexity of both 
public and private data, for the algorithm to achieve an  $\alpha$  estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm), is $\tilde{O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$ if $\alpha$ is not too small (i.e., $\alpha\geq \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$), where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This is a significant improvement over the previously known quasi-polynomial (in $\alpha$) or exponential (in $p$) complexity  of convex GLM with no public data.
We then extend our idea to the non-linear regression problem and show 
a similar phenomenon for it.
Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms through experiments on both synthethic and real world datasets. 
To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing the existence of efficient and practical 
algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression 
in the NLDP model with public unlabeled data.

<li><i>Inferring Ground Truth From Crowdsourced Data Under Local Attribute Differential Privacy.</i><a href="papers/TCS2021_truth.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> Abstract<a href="#TCS2021_truth" id="29_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('29');">&#9660</a>

        Recently, the problem of ground truth inference under local differential privacy (LDP) model has been recently studied. However, this problem is still not well understood and even some basic questions have not been solved yet. First, it is still unknown what is the average error of the private estimators to the underlying ground truth. Secondly, we do not known whether we can infer the ability of each user under LDP model and what is the estimation error w.r.t the underlying users ability. Finally, previous work only show that their methods have better performance than the private major voting algorithm through experiments. However, there is still no theoretically result which shows this priority formally or mathematically. In this paper, we partially solve these problems by studying the ground truth inference problem under local attribute differential privacy (LADP) model, and propose a new algorithm called private Dawid-Skene method, which is motivated by the classical Dawid-Skene method. Specifically, we first provide the estimation errors for both  ability of users and the ground truth under some assumptions of the problem if the algorithm start with some appropriate initial vector. Moreover, we propose an explicit instance and show that the estimation error of the ground truth achieved by the private major voting algorithm is always greater than the error achieved by our method.  To our best knowledge, this is the first result on showing the explicit estimation errors for both ability of users and ground truth for the problem. Also, this paper is  the first result on theoretically comparing with the private major voting algorithm.

    <div id="38" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the covariance matrix under differential privacy, where the underlying covariance matrix is assumed to be sparse and of high dimensions. We propose a new method, called DP-Thresholding, to achieve a non-trivial $\ell_2$-norm based error bound, 
        which is significantly better than the existing ones from adding noise directly to the empirical covariance matrix.  We also extend the $\ell_2$-norm based error bound to a general $\ell_w$-norm based one for any $1\leq w\leq \infty$, and show that they share the same upper bound asymptotically. Our approach can be easily extended to local differential privacy. Experiments on the synthetic datasets show consistent results with our theoretical claims.

    <div id="20" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the sparse linear regression problem in the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model. We first show that polynomial dependency on the dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable for the estimation error in both non-interactive and sequential interactive local models, if the privacy of the whole dataset needs to be preserved.  Similar limitations also exist for other types of error measurements and in the relaxed local models. This indicates that differential privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem. With the understanding of this limitation, we then present two algorithmic results. The first one is 
            a sequential interactive LDP algorithm for the low dimensional sparse case, called Locally Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (LDP-IHT), which achieves a near optimal upper bound. This algorithm is actually rather general and can be used to solve quite a few other problems, such as (Local) DP-ERM with sparsity constraints and sparse regression with non-linear measurements.  The second one is for the restricted (high dimensional) case where only  the privacy  of the responses (labels) needs to be preserved. For this case, 
            we show that the optimal rate of the error estimation can be made logarithmically depending on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$) in the local model, where an upper bound is obtained by a label-privacy version of LDP-IHT. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets confirm our theoretical analysis.

            As an important family of learning problems, pairwise learning has received much attention in recent years. Since pairwise learning involves pairs of instances in its loss function, it is more capable of modeling the relative relationships between instances compared with traditional pointwise learning (e.g., classification). In practice, many machine learning and data mining tasks can be categorized as pairwise learning. Although pairwise learning has achieved tremendous success in many real-world applications, the lack of transparency behind the behavior of the learned pairwise model impedes users from trusting the predicted results, which hampers its further applications in the real world. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we investigate how to enable interpretation in pairwise learning and propose a global interpretation method for pairwise learning. Based on the proposed global interpretation method, we can identify a minimal sufficient subset of data features that are sufficient in themselves to justify the global predictions made by the pairwise model. The identified minimal sufficient feature subset can help us better understand the overall behaviors of the learned pairwise model across different subpopulations of instance pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides global interpretation for pairwise learning. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed global interpretation method.

            It has been shown recently that many non-convex objective/loss functions in machine learning and deep learning are known to be strict saddle. This means that finding a second-order stationary point (i.e., approximate local minimum) and thus escaping saddle points are sufficient for such functions to obtain a classifier with good generalization performance. Existing algorithms for escaping saddle points, however, all fail to take into consideration a critical issue in their designs, that is, the protection of sensitive information in the training set. Models learned by such algorithms can often implicitly memorize the details of sensitive information, and thus offer opportunities for malicious parties to infer it from the learned models. In this paper, we investigate the problem of privately escaping saddle points and finding a second-order stationary point of the empirical risk of non-convex loss function.
            Previous result on this problem is mainly of theoretical importance and has several issues ({e.g., high sample complexity and non-scalable) which hinder its applicability, especially, in big data.  
            To deal with these issues,
            we propose in this paper a new method called Differentially Private Trust Region, and show that it outputs a second-order stationary point with high probability and less sample complexity, compared to the existing one. Moreover, we also provide a stochastic version of our method (along with some theoretical guarantees) to make it faster and more scalable. 
            Experiments on benchmark datasets suggest that our methods are indeed more efficient and practical than the previous one.

    <li><i>On Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Heavy-tailed Data.</i><a href="papers/ICML2020_DPSCO.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20y.html">Link</a>] Abstract<a href="#ICML2020_heavy" id="27_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('27');">&#9660</a>
        <div id="27" style="display:none;"><p> 
            In this paper, we consider the problem of designing Differentially Private (DP) algorithms for Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) on heavy-tailed data. The irregularity of such data violates some key assumptions used in almost all existing DP-SCO and DP-ERM methods, resulting in failure to provide the DP guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework, which has an excess population risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon^4})$ (after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the \textit{expected} excess population risk to $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{ n\epsilon^2 })$. To lift these additional conditions, we also provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based scheme to achieve excess population risks of $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^\frac{2}{3}}{(n\epsilon^2)^\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly convex and general convex loss functions, respectively, \textit{with high probability}. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our algorithms can effectively deal with the challenges caused by data irregularity.

            <div id="25" style="display:none;"><p>   In this paper we study the problem of estimating stochastic linear combination of non-linear regressions, which has a closed connection with many machine learning and statistical models such as non-linear regressions,  Single Index Models, Multi-index Models, Varying Coefficient Index Models and Two-layer Neural Networks. Specifically, we first show that under some mild assumptions, if the variates are multivariate Gaussian, then there is an algorithm whose outputs have  $\ell_2$-norm estimation error of $O(\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability, where $p$ is the dimensionality and $n$ is the size of samples. Moreover, we extend to the bounded sub-Gaussian case by using the zero-bias transformation, which could be seen as a generalization of the classical Stein's lemma. We show that with some additional assumptions there is an algorithm whose outputs have $\ell_\infty$-norm estimation error of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}+\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability. Finally, for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases we propose a scalable algorithm based on sub-sampling method and show that when the sub-sample size is large enough the estimation errors will be almost the same as previous ones. Experimental results for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases support our theoretical results. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper study and provide theoretical guarantees of the stochastic linear combination of non-linear regressions model.

                    Pairwise learning has received much attention recently as it is more capable of modeling the relative relationship between pairs of samples. Many machine learning tasks can be categorized as pairwise learning, such as AUC maximization and metric learning. Existing techniques for pairwise learning all fail to take into consideration a critical issue in their design, i.e., the protection of sensitive information in the training set. Models learned by such algorithms can implicitly memorize the details of sensitive information, which offers opportunity for malicious parties to infer it from the learned models. To address this challenging issue, in this paper, we propose several differentially private pairwise learning algorithms for both online and offline settings. Specifically, for the online setting, we first introduce a differentially private algorithm (called OnPairStrC) for strongly convex loss functions. Then, we extend this algorithm to general convex loss functions and give another differentially private algorithm (called OnPairC). For the offline setting, we also present two differentially private algorithms (called OffPairStrC and OffPairC) for strongly and general convex loss functions, respectively. These proposed algorithms can not only learn the model effectively from the data but also provide strong privacy protection guarantee for sensitive information in the training set. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms and the experimental results support our theoretical analysis.

                    Recently, there are increasingly more attentions paid to an important family of learning problems called pairwise learning, in which the associated loss functions depend on pairs of instances. Despite the tremendous success of pairwise learning in many real-world applications, the lack of transparency behind the learned pairwise models makes it difficult for users to understand how particular decisions are made by these models, which further impedes users from trusting the predicted results. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we study feature importance scoring as a specific approach to the problem of interpreting the predictions of black-box pairwise models. Specifically, we first propose a novel adaptive Shapley-value-based interpretation method, based on which a vector of importance scores associated with the underlying features of a testing instance pair can be adaptively calculated with the consideration of feature correlations, and these scores can be used to indicate which features make key contributions to the final prediction. Considering that Shapley-value-based methods are usually computationally challenging, we further propose a novel robust approximation interpretation method for pairwise models. This method is not only much more efficient but also robust to data noise. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate how to enable interpretation in pairwise learning. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

        <div id="16" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem in the non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model.  We first show that if the loss function is $(\infty, T)$-smooth, by using the Bernstein polynomial approximation we can avoid a dependency of the  sample complexity, to achieve error $\alpha$, on the exponential of the dimensionality $p$ with base $1/\alpha$  (i.e., $\alpha^{-p}$).
            This answers a question from (Smith et.al., 2017).   Then, we propose player-efficient algorithms with $1$-bit communication complexity and $O(1)$ computation cost for each player. The error bound of these algorithms is asymptotically the same as the original one. With some additional assumptions, we also give an algorithm which is more efficient for the server. Based on different types of polynomial approximations, we propose (efficient) non-interactive locally differential private algorithms for learning the set of k-way marginal queries and the set of smooth queries. Moreover, we study the case of  $1$-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss functions and show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-LDP algorithm whose sample complexity for achieving error $\alpha$ is only linear in the dimensionality $p$ and quasi-polynomial in other terms. To prove this, we first show that the conclusion holds for the hinge loss function. Then, we extend the result to any $1$-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss functions by showing that every such a function can be approximated by a linear combination of hinge loss functions and some linear functions. Our results use a polynomial of inner product approximation technique. Then we apply our technique to the Euclidean median problem and show that its sample complexity needs only to be quasi-polynomial in $p$, which is the first result with a sub-exponential sample complexity in $p$ for non-generalized linear loss functions.

Specifically, we propose a method called Trimmed (Gradient) Expectation Maximization which attaches a trimming gradients and hard thresholding step to the  Expectation step (E-step) and  Maximization step (M-step), respectively. Particularly, under some mild assumptions, with an appropriate initialization, we show that the algorithm is corruption-free and converges to the (near) optimal statistical rate geometrically when the fraction of corruption samples satisfies $\alpha\leq O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$. Moreover, we implement our general framework to three canonical examples: mixture of Gaussians, mixture of regressions and linear regression with missing covariates. Experiments also support our theoretical analysis.

                        Recently, many machine learning and statistical models such as non-linear regressions,  the Single Index, Multi-index, Varying Coefficient Index Models and Two-layer Neural Networks can be reduced to or be seen as a special case of a new model which is called the \textit{Stochastic Linear Combination of Non-linear Regressions} model. However, due to the high non-convexity of the problem, there is no previous work study how to estimate the model. In this paper, we provide the first study on how to estimate the model efficiently and scalably. Specifically, we first show that with some mild assumptions, if the variate vector $x$ is multivariate Gaussian, then there is an algorithm whose output vectors have $\ell_2$-norm estimation errors of $O(\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability, where $p$ is the dimension of $x$ and $n$ is the number of samples. The key idea of the proof is based on an observation motived by the Stein's lemma. Then we extend our result to the case where $x$ is bounded and sub-Gaussian using the zero-bias transformation, which could be seen as a generalization of the classic Stein's lemma. We also show that with some additional assumptions there is an algorithm whose output vectors have $\ell_\infty$-norm estimation errors of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}+\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability. We also provide a concrete example to show that there exists some link function which satisfies the previous assumptions. Finally, for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases we propose a faster sub-sampling based algorithm and show that when the sub-sample sizes are large enough then the estimation errors will not be sacrificed by too much. Experiments for both cases support our theoretical results. 
                        To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and provides theoretical guarantees for the stochastic linear combination of non-linear regressions model.

                        In this paper, we study the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem under the (distributed) non-interactive local differential privacy model.  For the low dimensional case (i.e., $p \ll n$), we show the optimal rate of $\Theta(\frac{kp}{n\epsilon^2})$ (omitting the eigenvalue terms) for the private minimax risk of the $k$-dimensional PCA using the squared subspace distance as the measurement, where $n$ is the sample size and $\epsilon$ is the privacy parameter. For the high dimensional (i.e., $p\gg n$) row sparse case, we first give a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{ks\log p }{n\epsilon^2})$ on the private minimax risk, where $s$ is the underlying sparsity parameter. Then we provide an efficient algorithm to achieve the upper bound of $O(\frac{s^2\log p}{n\epsilon^2})$. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets confirm our theoretical guarantees.

                In this paper we study the uncapacitated facility location problem in the
                model of differential privacy (DP) with uniform facility
                cost. Specifically, we first show that, under the \emph{hierarchically well-separated tree (HST) metrics} and the super-set output setting that was introduced in (Gupta et al 2010), there is an $\epsilon$-DP
                algorithm that achieves an $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
                (expected multiplicative) approximation ratio; this implies an
                $O(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon})$
                approximation ratio for the general metric case, where $n$ is the size of the input metric. These bounds improve
                the best-known results given by (Gupta et al 2010).  In particular, our approximation ratio for HST-metrics is independent of $n$, and the ratio for general metrics is independent of the aspect ratio of the input metric. On the negative side, we show that the approximation ratio of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$, even for instances on HST metrics with uniform facility cost, under the super-set output setting. The lower bound shows that the dependence of the approximation ratio for HST metrics on $\epsilon$ can not be removed or greatly improved. Our novel methods and techniques for both the upper and lower bound may find additional applications.

                    The prevalence of the World Wide Web enables the data collectors to easily share their data that are collected from a large crowd of users with the public. Although releasing crowdsourced data on the web brings many benefits to the data analyzers to conduct statistical analysis, it may violate crowd users' data privacy, which has been a major obstacle to release the crowdsourced data. A potential way to address this problem is to employ the traditional differential privacy-based mechanisms and perturb the data with some noise before publishing them. However, such noise perturbation mechanisms offer little data utility because crowdsourced datasets contain massive amounts of conflicting data records with large domains. In particular, this degraded utility results from two respects: firstly, the originally collected crowdsourced data usually contain conflicting data; secondly, the noise needed to guarantee differential privacy  may be proportional to the number of data records or the domain of the input data, which renders the released crowdsourced data useless. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel privacy-aware synthesizing method for crowdsourced data. In this method, the data collectors first learn the underlying distributions of the crowdsourced data through taking each user's fine grained reliability degrees into account. Then, a set of candidate synthetics are sampled from the learned distributions. Finally, these sampled candidate synthetics are subjected to privacy tests, and only those candidate synthetics which pass privacy tests are allowed to be safely released. The proposed method not only provides strong privacy protection for individual users but also generates high utility synthetic data. The desirable performance of the proposed method is verified via theoretical analysis and extensive experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

            <div id="10" style="display:none;"><p> 
                    We study the problem of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with (smooth) non-convex loss functions under the differential-privacy (DP) model. Existing approaches for this problem mainly adopt gradient norms to measure the error, which in general cannot guarantee the quality of the solution. To address this issue, 
                    we first study the expected excess empirical (or population) risk, which was primarily used as the utility to measure the quality for convex loss functions. Specifically, we show that
                    the excess empirical (or population) risk can be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\frac{d\log (1/\delta)}{\log n\epsilon^2})$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP settings, where $n$ is the data size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the space. 
                    The $\frac{1}{\log n}$ term in the empirical risk bound can be further improved to $\frac{1}{n^{\Omega(1)}}$ (when $d$ is a constant) by a highly non-trivial analysis on the time-average error. 
                    To obtain more efficient solutions, we also consider the connection between achieving differential privacy and finding approximate local minimum. 
                    Particularly, we show that when the size $n$ is large enough, there are $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms which can find an approximate local minimum of the empirical risk with high probability in both the constrained and non-constrained settings. 
                    These results indicate that one can escape saddle points privately.

            <div id="9" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the sparse linear regression problem under the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model. We first show that polynomial dependency on the dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable for the estimation error in both non-interactive and sequential interactive local models, if the privacy of the whole dataset needs to be preserved.  Similar limitations also exist for other types of error measurements and in the relaxed local models. This indicates that differential privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem. With the understanding of this limitation, we then present two algorithmic results. The first one is 
                a sequential interactive LDP algorithm for the low dimensional sparse case, called Locally Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (LDP-IHT), which achieves a near optimal upper bound. This algorithm is actually rather general and can be used to solve quite a few other problems, such as (Local) DP-ERM with sparsity constraints and sparse regression with non-linear measurements.  The second one is for the restricted (high dimensional) case where only  the privacy  of the responses (labels) needs to be preserved. For this case, 
                we show that the optimal rate of the error estimation can be made logarithmically depending on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$) in the local model, 
                where an upper bound is obtained by a label-privacy version of LDP-IHT. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets confirm our theoretical analysis.

Then, we extend the result to any $1$-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss functions by showing that every such function can be approximated by a linear combination of hinge loss functions and some linear functions. Finally, we apply our technique to the Euclidean median problem and show that its sample complexity needs only to be quasi-polynomial in $p$, which is the first result with a sub-exponential sample complexity in $p$ for non-generalized linear loss functions. Our results are based on a technique, called polynomial of inner product approximation, which may be applicable to other problems.

<div id="5" style="display:none;"><p>			In this paper, we study the Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-ERM) problem with non-convex loss functions and  give several upper bounds for the utility in different settings. We  first consider the problem in low-dimensional space. For DP-ERM with non-smooth regularizer, we generalize an existing work by measuring the utility using $\ell_2$ norm of the projected gradient. Also, we extend the error bound measurement, for the first time, from empirical risk to population risk by using the expected $\ell_2$ norm of the gradient. We then investigate the problem in high dimensional space, and show that by measuring the utility with Frank-Wolfe gap, it is possible to bound the utility by the Gaussian Width of the constraint set, instead of the dimensionality $p$ of the underlying space. We further demonstrate that the advantages of this result can be achieved by the measure of $\ell_2$ norm of the projected gradient. A somewhat surprising discovery is that although the two kinds of measurements are quite different, their induced utility upper bounds are asymptotically the same under some assumptions. We also show that the utility of some special non-convex loss functions can be reduced to a level  (i.e., depending only on $\log p$) similar to that of  convex loss functions. Finally, we test our proposed algorithms on both synthetic and real world datasets and the experimental results confirm our theoretical analysis.

Combining the method with  (accelerated) mini-batch SGD, we can achieve an approximate solution  with a time complexity lower than that of 
        the state-of-the-art techniques for the low precision case. Our idea can also be extended to the high precision case, which gives an alternative implementation to the Iterative Hessian Sketch (IHS) method with significantly improved time complexity.

<div id="4" style="display:none;"><p>In this paper, we revisit the Empirical Risk Minimization problem in the non-interactive local model of differential privacy. In the case of constant or low dimensions ($p\ll n$), we first show that if the  loss function is $(\infty, T)$-smooth,  we can avoid a dependence of the  sample complexity, to achieve error $\alpha$, on the exponential of the dimensionality $p$ with base $1/\alpha$  (i.e., $\alpha^{-p}$),
    which answers a question in (Smith et al 2017).  Our approach is based on polynomial approximation. Then, we propose player-efficient algorithms with $1$-bit communication complexity and $O(1)$ computation cost for each player. The error bound is asymptotically the same as the original one. With some additional assumptions, we also give an efficient algorithm for the server. 
    In the case of high dimensions ($n\ll p$),
   we show that if the loss function is a convex generalized linear function,  the error  can be bounded by using the Gaussian width of the constrained set, instead of $p$, which improves the one in    
     Smith et al.
     Our techniques can be extended to some related problems, such as $k$-way marginal queries and smooth queries. </p></div> </br>

Based on the idea of that, we propose a general covariance perturbation method, and then for $\epsilon$-differential privacy, we analyze Laplacian and Wishart mechanisms, for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy we analyze Gaussian and Wishart mechanisms. Moreover, we extend the covariance perturbation algorithm to distributed setting and local differential privacy. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets are also support our theoretical analysis.

    <div id="2" style="display:none;"><p>In this paper, we revisit the large-scale constrained linear regression problem and	propose faster methods based on some recent developments in sketching and optimization. 
        Our algorithm combines mini-batch SGD with a new method called two-step preconditioning to achieve an $\epsilon$-accuracy solution for the low precision case, and has a lower time complexity than the state-of-the-art techniques. Our idea can also be extended to the high precision case, which gives an alternative implementation to the Iterative Hessian Sketch (IHS) method with significantly improved time complexity. 
        Experiments on benchmark and synthetic datasets suggest that our methods indeed outperform existing ones considerably in both the low and high precision cases.

        <div id="1" style="display:none;"><p>In this paper we study the differentially private Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem in different settings. For smooth (strongly) convex loss function with or without (non)-smooth regularization, we give algorithms that achieve either optimal or near optimal utility bounds with less gradient complexity compared with previous work.  For ERM with smooth convex loss function in high-dimensional ($p\gg n$) setting, we give an algorithm which achieves the upper bound with less gradient complexity than previous ones. At last, we generalize the expected excess empirical risk from convex loss functions to non-convex ones satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and give a tighter upper bound on   
            the utility than the one in (Zhang et al 2017).

            In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. 
Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to process 
some additional public but unlabeled data. 
We first show that 
there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for 
GLM (under some mild assumptions), if each data record is i.i.d sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. 
The sample complexity of both 
public and private data, for the algorithm to achieve an  $\alpha$  estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm), is $\tilde{O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$ if $\alpha$ is not too small 
(i.e., $\alpha\geq \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$), where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This is a significant improvement over the previously known quasi-polynomial (in $\alpha$) or exponential (in $p$) complexity  of convex GLM with no public data.
We then extend our idea to the non-linear regression problem and show 
a similar phenomenon for it.
Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms through experiments on both synthethic and real world datasets. 
To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing the existence of efficient and practical 
algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression 
in the NLDP model with public unlabeled data.

            <div id="6" style="display:none;"><p>In this paper, we study high dimensional sparse linear regression under the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model, and give both negative and positive results. On the negative side, we show that polynomial dependency on the dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable in the estimation error under the non-interactive local model, if the privacy of the whole dataset needs to be preserved.  Similar limitations also exist for other types of error measurements and in the (sequential) interactive local or relaxed local models. This indicates that differential privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem.  On the positive side, we show that the optimal rate of the error estimation can be made  logarithmically depending on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$) under the local model,  if only the privacy  of the responses (labels) is to be preserved, where   the upper bound is obtained by a new method called Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (DP-IHT), which is interesting in its own right. Our result can also be extended  to some non-linear monotone measurement models while keeping the responses locally private.
