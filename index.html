                In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. 
        Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to process 
        some additional public but unlabeled data. 
        We first show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for 
        GLM (under some mild assumptions), if each data record is i.i.d sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. 
        The sample complexity of both 
        public and private data, for the algorithm to achieve an  $\alpha$  estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm), is $\tilde{O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$ if $\alpha$ is not too small (i.e., $\alpha\geq \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$), where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This is a significant improvement over the previously known quasi-polynomial (in $\alpha$) or exponential (in $p$) complexity  of convex GLM with no public data.
        We then extend our idea to the non-linear regression problem and show 
        a similar phenomenon for it.
        Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms through experiments on both synthethic and real world datasets. 
        To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing the existence of efficient and practical 
        algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression 
        in the NLDP model with public unlabeled data.

        <div id="20" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the sparse linear regression problem in the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model. We first show that polynomial dependency on the dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable for the estimation error in both non-interactive and sequential interactive local models, if the privacy of the whole dataset needs to be preserved.  Similar limitations also exist for other types of error measurements and in the relaxed local models. This indicates that differential privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem. With the understanding of this limitation, we then present two algorithmic results. The first one is 
                a sequential interactive LDP algorithm for the low dimensional sparse case, called Locally Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (LDP-IHT), which achieves a near optimal upper bound. This algorithm is actually rather general and can be used to solve quite a few other problems, such as (Local) DP-ERM with sparsity constraints and sparse regression with non-linear measurements.  The second one is for the restricted (high dimensional) case where only  the privacy  of the responses (labels) needs to be preserved. For this case, 
                we show that the optimal rate of the error estimation can be made logarithmically depending on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$) in the local model, 
                where an upper bound is obtained by a label-privacy version of LDP-IHT. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets confirm our theoretical analysis.

        <div id="16" style="display:none;"><p> In this paper, we study the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem in the non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model.  We first show that if the loss function is $(\infty, T)$-smooth, by using the Bernstein polynomial approximation we can avoid a dependency of the  sample complexity, to achieve error $\alpha$, on the exponential of the dimensionality $p$ with base $1/\alpha$  (i.e., $\alpha^{-p}$).
            This answers a question from (Smith et.al., 2017).   Then, we propose player-efficient algorithms with $1$-bit communication complexity and $O(1)$ computation cost for each player. The error bound of these algorithms is asymptotically the same as the original one. With some additional assumptions, we also give an algorithm which is more efficient for the server. Based on different types of polynomial approximations, we propose (efficient) non-interactive locally differential private algorithms for learning the set of k-way marginal queries and the set of smooth queries. Moreover, we study the case of  $1$-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss functions and show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-LDP algorithm whose sample complexity for achieving error $\alpha$ is only linear in the dimensionality $p$ and quasi-polynomial in other terms. To prove this, we first show that the conclusion holds for the hinge loss function. Then, we extend the result to any $1$-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss functions by showing that every such a function can be approximated by a linear combination of hinge loss functions and some linear functions. Our results use a polynomial of inner product approximation technique. Then we apply our technique to the Euclidean median problem and show that its sample complexity needs only to be quasi-polynomial in $p$, which is the first result with a sub-exponential sample complexity in $p$ for non-generalized linear loss functions.

<li><i>On Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Heavy-tailed Data</i><a href="papers/ICML2020_DPSCO.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20y.html">Link</a>] Abstract<a href="#ICML2020_heavy" id="27_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('27');">&#9660</a>
    <div id="27" style="display:none;"><p> 
        In this paper, we consider the problem of designing Differentially Private (DP) algorithms for Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) on heavy-tailed data. The irregularity of such data violates some key assumptions used in almost all existing DP-SCO and DP-ERM methods, resulting in failure to provide the DP guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework, which has an excess population risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon^4})$ (after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the \textit{expected} excess population risk to $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{ n\epsilon^2 })$. To lift these additional conditions, we also provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based scheme to achieve excess population risks of $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^\frac{2}{3}}{(n\epsilon^2)^\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly convex and general convex loss functions, respectively, \textit{with high probability}. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our algorithms can effectively deal with the challenges caused by data irregularity.

<li><i>Facility Location Problem in Differential Privacy Model Revisited.</i><a href="papers/NeurIPS2019_facility.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9056-facility-location-problem-in-differential-privacy-model-revisited">Link</a>] Abstract<a href="#NeurIPS2019_facility" id="23_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('23');">&#9660</a>
    <div id="23" style="display:none;"><p> 
        In this paper we study the uncapacitated facility location problem in the
        model of differential privacy (DP) with uniform facility
        cost. Specifically, we first show that, under the \emph{hierarchically well-separated tree (HST) metrics} and the super-set output setting that was introduced in (Gupta et al 2010), there is an $\epsilon$-DP
        algorithm that achieves an $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
        (expected multiplicative) approximation ratio; this implies an
        $O(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon})$
        approximation ratio for the general metric case, where $n$ is the size of the input metric. These bounds improve
        the best-known results given by (Gupta et al 2010).  In particular, our approximation ratio for HST-metrics is independent of $n$, and the ratio for general metrics is independent of the aspect ratio of the input metric. On the negative side, we show that the approximation ratio of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$, even for instances on HST metrics with uniform facility cost, under the super-set output setting. The lower bound shows that the dependence of the approximation ratio for HST metrics on $\epsilon$ can not be removed or greatly improved. Our novel methods and techniques for both the upper and lower bound may find additional applications.

        <div id="10" style="display:none;"><p> 
                We study the problem of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with (smooth) non-convex loss functions under the differential-privacy (DP) model. Existing approaches for this problem mainly adopt gradient norms to measure the error, which in general cannot guarantee the quality of the solution. To address this issue, 
                we first study the expected excess empirical (or population) risk, which was primarily used as the utility to measure the quality for convex loss functions. Specifically, we show that
                the excess empirical (or population) risk can be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\frac{d\log (1/\delta)}{\log n\epsilon^2})$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP settings, where $n$ is the data size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the space. 
                The $\frac{1}{\log n}$ term in the empirical risk bound can be further improved to $\frac{1}{n^{\Omega(1)}}$ (when $d$ is a constant) by a highly non-trivial analysis on the time-average error. 
                To obtain more efficient solutions, we also consider the connection between achieving differential privacy and finding approximate local minimum. 
                Particularly, we show that when the size $n$ is large enough, there are $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms which can find an approximate local minimum of the empirical risk with high probability in both the constrained and non-constrained settings. 
                These results indicate that one can escape saddle points privately.

        <div id="1" style="display:none;"><p>In this paper we study the differentially private Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem in different settings. For smooth (strongly) convex loss function with or without (non)-smooth regularization, we give algorithms that achieve either optimal or near optimal utility bounds with less gradient complexity compared with previous work.  For ERM with smooth convex loss function in high-dimensional ($p\gg n$) setting, we give an algorithm which achieves the upper bound with less gradient complexity than previous ones. At last, we generalize the expected excess empirical risk from convex loss functions to non-convex ones satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and give a tighter upper bound on   
            the utility than the one in (Zhang et al 2017).

        As one popular technique for estimating the maximum likelihood 
        of mixture models or incomplete data problems, (Gradient) Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm presents a challenge for preserving privacy of sensitive data. While although there are already some Differentially Private (DP) variants of (Gradient) EM algorithm, however, unlike in the non-private case, there is still no finite sample statistical guarantees. To address this issue, in this paper we propose the first DP variant of (Gradient) EM algorithm with statistical guarantees.  Moreover, we apply our general framework to three canonical models: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Mixture of Regressions Model (MRM) and Linear Regression with Missing Covariates (RMC). Specifically, for GMM in the DP model, our estimation error is near optimal in some cases. And for other two models in the DP model, we provide the first finite sample statistical guarantees.  Our theory is supported by thorough numerical results.

            Optimal Rates of (Locally) Differentially Private Heavy-tailed

            In this paper we study the problem of stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) in the (local) differential privacy (DP/LDP) model. Unlike the previous results which need to assume bounded reward distributions, here we mainly focus on the case the reward distribution of each arm only has $(1+v)$-th moment with some $v\in (0, 1]$. In the first part, we study the problem in the central $\epsilon$-DP model. We first provide a near-optimal result by developing a private and robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the result via a private and robust version of the Successive Elimination (SE) algorithm. Finally, we show that the instance-dependent regret bound of our improved algorithm is optimal by showing its lower bound. In the second part of the paper, we study the problem in the $\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose an algorithm which could be seen as locally private and robust version of the SE algorithm,  and show it could achieve  (near) optimal rates for both  instance-dependent and instance-independent regrets. All of the above results can also reveal the differences between the problem of private MAB with bounded rewards and heavy-tailed rewards.  To achieve these (near) optimal rates, we develop several new hard instances and private robust estimators as byproducts, which might could be used to other related problems. Finally, experimental results also support our theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of our algorithms.

                    As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and differential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the previous work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular data in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges arising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first study on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional space. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint (such as the $\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth and its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get an error bound of $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for LASSO,  if the data  distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we improve the bound to $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{2}{5}})$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP model.  In the second part of the paper, we study DP-SCO for sparse learning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear regression and propose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*2}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the underlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity ({\em i.e.,} $\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*\frac{3}{2}}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, which is also near optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}{(\sqrt{s^*})}$,  if the loss function is smooth and strongly convex.

        On Facility Location Problem in the Central and Local Differential Privacy Model.</i><a href="papers/nips21.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> Abstract<a href="#NIPS2021" id="38_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('38');">&#9660</a>

            We revisit the facility location problem in the differential privacy (DP) model and solve several open problems proposed by previous work. In the first part we focus on the problem in the central $\epsilon$-DP model. Under the hierarchically well-separated tree (HST) metric and the super-set output setting, \cite{prev2019} showed a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$  on the approximation ratio, and an algorithm achieving $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ approximation in the case of uniform facility cost. In this paper, we show that there is an $\epsilon$-DP algorithm with $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$ approximation ratio for the general non-uniform facility cost setting. So, not only our result closes the gap between the upper and lower bounds, but also it extends the result of \cite{prev2019} to the non-uniform case.

            In the second part of the paper, we focus on the problem in the local DP (LDP) model. In the problem, whether a client participates in the facility location instance is the private information that needs to be protected. Under the HST metric, we show that there is a non-interactive algorithm achieving $O(\frac{N^{\frac{1}{4}}}{\epsilon^2})$ approximation ratio, where $N$ is the size of the metric. On the negative side, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{N^{\frac{1}{4}}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$ on the approximation ratio for any non-interactive $\epsilon$-LDP algorithm. So our ratio is tight in terms of $N$.

        <li><i>Towards Assessment of Randomized Mechanisms for
            Certifying Adversarial Robustness.</i><a href="papers/NeurIPS2020_RandomSmoothing.pdf"><img src="pdf_icon.gif" class="smallpadleft"/></a> Abstract<a href="#NIPS2020_random" id="28_arrows" class="arrows" onclick="expand_collapse('28');">&#9660</a>

                As a certified defensive technique, randomized smoothing has received considerable attention due to its scalability to large datasets and neural networks. However, several important questions remain unanswered, such as (i) whether the Gaussian mechanism is an appropriate option for certifying $\ell_2$-norm robustness, and (ii) whether there is an appropriate randomized mechanism to certify $\ell_\infty$-norm robustness 
                for high-dimensional datasets. To shed light on these questions, the main difficulty is how to assess each randomized mechanism. In this paper, we propose a generic framework, which connects the existing frameworks in (Lecuyer et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019), to assess randomized mechanisms. 
                Under our framework, for a mechanism which can certify a certain extent of robustness, we define the magnitude ({\em i.e.,} the expected $\ell_\infty$ norm) of the randomized noise it adds as the metric for assessing its appropriateness. We also derive lower bounds on the metric for $\ell_2$-norm and $\ell_\infty$-norm cases as the criteria for assessment.
                Based on our framework, we assess the Gaussian and Exponential mechanisms by comparing the magnitude of noise added by these mechanisms and the corresponding criteria. We first conclude that the Gaussian mechanism is an appropriate option to certify $\ell_2$-norm robustness. Moreover, surprisingly, we also show that the Gaussian mechanism is also an appropriate option for certifying $\ell_\infty$-norm robustness, instead of the Exponential mechanism.
                Finally, we verify our theoretical results by evaluations on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.
